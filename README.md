This is another little project that I developed in the seven section of Angela Yu's IOS development <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/" target="_blank">course</a>. The goal of this tutorial is to dive into a simple iOS recipe - how to play sound and use an Apple library called AVFoundation, exploring StackOverflow, Apple Documentation and learning how to search for solutions effectively.
